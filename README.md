# RISC-V
Implementation of RISC-V processor in three methods,
- Single cycle
- Pipeline

Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of Single Cycle and Pipeline:

| Instruction Type | Instructions               |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| R-Type           | add, sub, and, or, slt     |
| I-Type           | lw, addi, ori, slti, jalr  |
| S-Type           | sw                          |
| J-Type           | jal                         |
| B-Type           | beq, bne                    |
| U-Type           | lui                         |



- Multi cycle

ISA of multi cycle

| Instruction Mnemonic and Definition |
|------------------------------------|
| ADD                                |
| SUB                                |
| AND                                |
| NOT                                |
| PUSH (Load Address)                |
| POP (Store Address)                |
| JMP (Jump Address)                 |
| JZ (Jump if Zero)                  |
